	<h1 class="post-title">Security</h1>
	<p>The NYC-DSA Tech Action InfoSec subcommittee (whew) initially started as a small Signal group of NYC-DSA members interested in InfoSec. They eventually organized into an official subcommittee within Tech Action. What is InfoSec? Think of it as Digital Safety. As activists, we face plenty of threats online (and in real life). We want to make sure people have tools to defend themselves against online nazis, stalkers, the local police, or even their anti-socialist boss.</p>
	<p>If you want to join InfoSec, or just have a general question about what we do, please reach out to us at nyc-dsa-infosec@protonmail.com.</p>
	<p>Each section below covers a core focus of what we do as a group.</p>
	<h3 class="post-subtitle">We produce training documents for NYC-DSA</h3>
	<p>As a group, we have produced a 1-sheet training document for general NYC-DSA members, covering Signal, Password Managers, 2 Factor Authentication and Doxxing Prevention. We’re interested in producing more documents in the future for specific internal cases.</p>
	<h3 class="post-subtitle">We run digital safety trainings</h3>
	<p>We don’t just hand out digital safety docs and hope members follow through. We run 1-on-1 trainings, as well as larger trainings for branch meetings. Our goal is to have several trainers in every branch, with enough trainers total to hold at least 1 training per month, and perhaps 1 bigger (branch) training per quarter. If you’re interested in training for your branch, working group, allied group, or if you want to be a trainer yourself (and we’ll train you!), please reach out to us.</p>
	<h3 class="post-subtitle">We work with the DSA Marshal team</h3>
	<p>The DSA Marshal team has reached out to InfoSec to create and run specific trainings for protests, both for attendees and marshals. We will also build out some security requirements for marshals who plan on running events. InfoSec is considered one of the core competencies within the Marshal group alongside protest marshaling, and street medicking.</p>
	<h3 class="post-subtitle">We provide security counselling</h3>
	<p>There is a lot of jargon surrounding InfoSec, and for the layperson, it can lead to inaction. We want to be a resource for any DSA member with a  security question. To this end we have setup 2 protonmail accounts to field questions from members and allies, whether DSA or not.</p>
	<p>If you have a digital safety question re: your org, your situation, or you just need help, please reach out to us at nyc-dsa-infosec-hotline@protonmail.com.</p>
	<p>We promise to respond to you eventually, to the best of our ability, or at least try and point you to a resource that can help.</p>
	<p>If you want to join InfoSec, or just have a general question about what we do, please reach out to us at nyc-dsa-infosec@protonmail.com.</p>
	<p>If you are already a member, you can reach out to us on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-gb#!forum/nyc-dsa-tech-action-infosec-subcommittee" target="_blank">google group</a>.</p>
	<h3 class="post-subtitle">We work on data policies</h3>
	<p>We are currently drafting a data policy proposal for the upcoming convention. This proposal aims to set basic standards to protect membership data from malicious actors If you are interested in working on this proposal, or if your group would want to be part of a trial run for this data policy please let us know.</p>
