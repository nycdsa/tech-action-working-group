title: VERIZON FIOS & THE LABOR PERSPECTIVE ON MUNICIPAL BROADBAND
category: curricula
---
This March is a continuation of our January meeting on private vs. public internet. The topic this time is **Verizon FiOS & the Labor Perspective on Municipal Broadband** with special guest speaker Bob Master! 

Bob is the District 1 Political Director of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) – the union representing Verizon FiOS technicians, and the largest union to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2016. He's also a co-founder of the NY Working Families Party and a longtime socialist labor organizer. It's hard to find a better guest speaker on this topic!

    * How did neoliberalism in the 80s tip the balance of power in favor of cable/fiber providers and what have labor unions done to fight against them?

    * How did the city's deal with Verizon to install fiber internet service ("FiOS") across the entire city come about, and how has Verizon's profit motive led to crappier, unequal service?

    * How does the feasibility of a hypothetical citywide public broadband internet service in NYC compare to that of the program in Chattanooga, and would organized labor support such a program anyway?

These are the kinds of questions we'll discuss with Bob in this meeting. To prepare for it, we ask that you read or skim the following articles in advance. They're not required so you're free to show up regardless, but we think they'll provide useful context for the discussion.

    1. *[1 million NYC homes can’t get Verizon FiOS, so the city just sued Verizon](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/nyc-sues-verizon-alleges-failure-to-complete-citywide-fiber-rollout/)*, Ars Technica.
    News article from a year ago about the city's lawsuit against Verizon for breach of the FiOS contract.
     
    2. *[The New Sewer Socialists Are Building an Equitable Internet](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-new-sewer-socialists-are-building-an-equitable-internet/)*, The Nation/Logic. 
    All about the wildly successful municipal broadband program in Chattanooga, written by Tech Action member and previous guest speaker Evan Malmgren.
     
    3. *[Municipal Fiber Networks and Public Private Partnerships for Fiber Deployment: A Summary of the Evidence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bzA-Fm8ZxWEWqtfLDCP1VUoFYx8wzm_OA-xKV_KOnM/edit)*, CWA.
    CWA research summary, dated a few years ago, on municipal broadband programs around the US and the union's view of their strengths, weaknesses, and feasibility.

In the meeting there'll be a guided Q&A with Bob, with some audience Q&A mixed in along the way, followed by political discussions in smaller groups. The meeting is open to anyone who's socialist-curious and interested in the politics of tech—not just DSA members.
