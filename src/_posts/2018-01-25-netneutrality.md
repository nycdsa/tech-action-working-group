Please join us on Thursday, January 25, for our first general meeting of 2018, **From Net Neutrality to Public Internet**. We'll be taking a look at the excitement around net neutrality and how we can shift that energy to thinking about *who owns the infrastructure of the internet*. We’ve got two great speakers lined up:

* **Yasha Levine**, journalist and author of the forthcoming book *Surveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet*, who’s gonna tell us the largely-forgotten **story of the privatization of the internet**, and

* **Evan Malmgren**, writer, Tech Action member, and author of recent articles about net neutrality and municipal broadband (see below), who will make **the case for public internet ownership**.

To prepare for the meeting and give us some context for our discussion, the Tech Action OC suggests that you read the following brief articles:

1. *[Backbone Bullies](http://web.archive.org/web/20010628083603/http://forbes.com:80/global/2000/0612/0312056a.html)*, Forbes (2000). An oldie but goodie for understanding some of the outcome of the public vs. private tension in the earlier days of the internet.

2. *[Nationalize the Networks](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/net-neutrality-repeal-case-for-public-broadband)*, Dissent, by our speaker Evan. This article really encapsulates the theme for the meeting. Essential reading!

3. *[Koch Brothers Are Cities' New Obstacle to Building Broadband](https://www.wired.com/story/koch-brothers-are-cities-new-obstacle-to-building-broadband/)*, Wired. Get a taste for how capital organizes to politically oppose the kind of public internet we want.

*And a few additional readings for the particularly curious:*

* Re: Privatization of the Internet, there’s no good source in the left political media! Instead, check out this [law journal article from the early 00s](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y9ejTMwAszYN5fGHbQhgi0_8zMymvLeK), but only Sections IV and V, which are pretty self-contained and fairly readable.

* Re: Municipal broadband, see Evan’s [other recent article](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-new-sewer-socialists-are-building-an-equitable-internet/) on the successful municipal broadband in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

* Check out the [very brief bill](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+HB705+hil) for statewide net neutrality in Virginia just produced by the newly elected socialist state legislator and DSA member Lee Carter.

* Ben Tarnoff, co-founder of Logic magazine, writing in Jacobin in 2016 [about the public origin of the Internet](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/internet-public-dns-privatization-icann-netflix/).
