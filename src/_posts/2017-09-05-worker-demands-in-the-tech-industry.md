Hello comrades of the computer,

The next NYC-DSA Tech Action working group meeting will be Tuesday, September 5th, from 7 to 8:30pm at the same place, 114 W. 26th St., Manhattan, 4th floor. Our topic will be **worker demands in the tech industry**.

In this meeting we'll discuss demands from organized workers: first some precedent in both tech and non-tech industries, based on the readings below 📕, and then we'll articulate our own demands to stretch our socialist muscles. 💪

To prepare for the meeting, please look over the following four readings, all of which shouldn't be too jargon-y for you. "FOUR?!" I know, I know. 1, 2, and 4 are manageable, and 3 is like half a page. You can do it! ... but if you don't, that's okay too, you should still come to the meeting. There's a guided question for each.

1. [As temp sector grew, so did appeal of union: Microsoft campus labmates bargain for benefits](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/13/union-for-temporary-workers-speaks-demands-growing-sector/iXlaeB763s0E1gwLZimZ1M/story.html), Boston Globe, 2015. On the organizing efforts by Microsoft contractors that do bug testing.

    * **How does their status as contractors affect their demands and their organizing?**

2. [Chronicle of a Strike](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/verizon-strike-fios-cwa-union-replacements/), Jacobin, 2016. On the successful 2016 strike by CWA-affiliated Verizon technicians and wireless workers (which NYC-DSA played a significant role in).

    * **What from their problems and demands might be relevant in the tech industry?**

3. [Italian IBM workers strike](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwGaHQ-JvwEMOV9uSDlKVWRNZE0/view?usp=sharing), Computer People for Peace, 1973(?). A fun little historical note. Sorry about the image quality. Check out their slogan "Blue Collar, White Collar, Same Fight!" -- a great example of what we talked about in our last meeting!

    * **How do their demands take into account an inequality in the workplace?**

4. [Reasons to be Skeptical of Silicon Valley's 'Never Again' Pledge](https://theoutline.com/post/591/reasons-to-be-skeptical-of-silicon-valley-s-latest-pledge), The Outline, 2016. On the "Never Again" pledge by individual tech workers not to build a so-called Muslim registry for Trump.

    * **In what ways does the pledge differ from the others kinds of demands we're talking about?**

When you're reading over those, think about the following questions re the workers' demands described in the articles:

> * Are the demands universally applicable to the workers in a particular tech workplace? How might demands be made in solidarity with contractors?

> * Do the demands appeal to (material) self-interest or to compassion? In cases of fighting for a minority group (e.g. women in tech), how can that gap be bridged?

> * Do the demands address only the workers themselves, or do they have a political reach beyond the workplace?

And most importantly, **think about your own demands!** 🤔 As an exercise we'll see what our own members want changed in their tech (or tech-esque) workplaces. You might find some *sweet relief* when you hear what your comrades say.
